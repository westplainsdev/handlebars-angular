        <h1>Hello, JavaScript Developer!</h1>
        <p>This is a Node.js, Express, Handlebars and AngularJS Example Site.
            It includes several examples of Handlebar templating along with a form which
            posts back to an Express endpoint. Last, we have a few Angular Single Page Applications
            wired up to demonstrate the plug and play ability of this framework.
            Use this template as a starting point to create something more unique.</p>
